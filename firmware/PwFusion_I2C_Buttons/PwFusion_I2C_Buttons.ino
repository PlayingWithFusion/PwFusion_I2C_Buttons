* ADDITIONAL NOTES:
* This file contains functions to flash an AtTiny841-MMHR included in
* the Playing with Fusion i2c buttons interface board (IFB-40003).
* Funcionality is as described below:
*   - Read values from the buttons
*   - Pack values into a register struct
*   - Send values over the i2c bus when requested
